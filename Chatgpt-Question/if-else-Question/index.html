Got it! Chapter 8 of "A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript" focuses on concatenation of strings. Here are 15 coding questions related to string concatenation:

1. Write a function that concatenates two strings together.
   
2. Create a function that concatenates multiple strings into a single string.

3. Implement a function that takes an array of strings and concatenates them into a single sentence with proper punctuation.

4. Write a function that accepts two strings and checks if they can be concatenated to form a palindrome.

5. Create a function that concatenates a given string `n` times.

6. Write a function that takes an array of words and concatenates them into a sentence with proper spacing.

7. Implement a function that takes a string and a number `n`, and repeats the string `n` times using concatenation.

8. Write a function that concatenates a string with a specified prefix and suffix.

9. Create a function that joins two arrays of strings into a single array, concatenating corresponding elements.

10. Implement a function that concatenates strings from an object's properties into a single string.

11. Write a function that concatenates a string with itself in reverse.

12. Create a function that accepts two strings and concatenates them with a separator between them.

13. Write a function that concatenates strings from an array, ignoring any empty strings.

14. Implement a function that constructs a URL from multiple parts (protocol, domain, path, parameters).

15. Write a function that takes a string and capitalizes the first letter of each word, then concatenates them into a single string.

These questions should help you practice and deepen your understanding of string concatenation techniques as covered in Chapter 8 of the book.
